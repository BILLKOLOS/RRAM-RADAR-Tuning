## BER/Time/Temp Plots

These use (manually) extracted data to show the relationship between these three variables.

## Distributions (dist)

These show how the distributions for each range are arranged pre/post-bake.

## Relaxation Sigma Mu

Shows how the dependence of resistance spreading on the resistance range.

## Retention Calculation

Calculates temperature/baking time required for retention target.
